## Origin Frontend Take-Home Assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It uses the following technologies:

- Jest and React Testing Library
- date-fns for manipulating dates
- react-imask for masking/formatting input
- styled-components for styling
- prop-types for props validation
- ESLint for linting
- Prettier for formatting
- GitHub Actions for a simple CI/CD

Demo UI:

Next steps:

- [ ] Refactor to TypeScript (necessary to ease the js pain...)
- [ ] Improve currency and date manipulation
